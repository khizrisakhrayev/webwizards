            <p>Our Hour of Code project was about self-improvement and community engagement. It all started with the completion of the Computer Science Fundamentals: Express Course (2023), a critical step toward honing our algorithmic skills. While navigating the course in Azerbaijani, we encountered translation difficulties, but our determination to understand computer science principles remained unwavering.

                <hr>After finishing the course, our next step was to find a suitable location for our Hour of Code event. Despite initial setbacks, we secured School No. 292, which is located in the Bina Atchilig housing estate. Despite the distance from the city center, we were determined to reach out to students in underserved areas.
                
                
                <hr>On the day of the event, we encountered technical difficulties, including the lack of a suitable projector for our presentation. However, our resourcefulness came to the fore when we improvised by sharing our screen using a teacher's phone. This solution allowed us to continue with our session, albeit with minor adjustments.
                
                <hr>As students filled the classroom, we began an interactive journey through coding puzzles. We created a collaborative and supportive environment while guiding our peers through the challenges. Despite time constraints, we encouraged students to collaborate, helping each other overcome obstacles and understand the fundamental concepts of coding.
                
                
                <hr>In addition to the coding exercises, we took the opportunity to share information about ADA University and our own academic journeys. Addressing older students, we emphasized the importance of pursuing programming opportunities and participating in international competitions. The session created lively discussions and encouraged students to pursue new opportunities in technology and education.
                
                <hr>As the event came to a close, we thanked the school director for his support and hospitality. Our Hour of Code project illustrates the transformative power of education and collaboration, encouraging future innovators to pursue their passions and make a positive difference in their communities.</p>
